The "Insurance Tax Validator" will allow law enforcers to install and application on their mobile devices that will verify the integrity of the driver and the vehicle. The environment will connect to a centralised database that will store the vehicle’s registration, NCT, Road Tax, and Insurance; these individually updated by the corresponding organisation.
By implementing IoT through an NFC label, it will act as a bridge between the cloud environment and the enforcer’s mobile device. It is thus allowing the enforcer to view real-time data based on any vehicle scanned. The label will contain a digitally unique key that will allow the communication between hardware and software — this NFC enabled sticker is given to vehicle users to place on their windscreen. It will provide enforcers with the opportunity to scan vehicles on the go and have immediate access to car history. While impacting paper usage and significantly reducing it, will and ultimately give drivers more visibility by clearing windscreen real estate.

The technologies I used so far are:              
- Design and Build Frontend (Android application and Comms Device) Java, Gradle, Maven & NFC Device.
- Design and Build Application Backend (API's, Applications) with Apache Servers, Java, Python & SQL,
- Implement design using Oracle cloud applications with OCI (VM’s, Virtual Networks, Autonomous DB’s, OIM, Blockchain).                                                                                                                                     
- Document my progress through public articles and open source all development files.
